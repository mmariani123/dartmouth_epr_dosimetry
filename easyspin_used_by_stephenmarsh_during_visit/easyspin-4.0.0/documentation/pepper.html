<div class="subtitle">Description</div>

<p>
<code>pepper</code> calculates cw EPR spectra for powders, frozen solutions
and single crystals.
</p>

<p>
There are up to three possible output arguments

<ul>
<li>
If  no output argument is requested, <code>pepper</code> plots
the simulated spectrum.
<li>
<code>spec</code> contains the calculated spectrum or spectra.
<li>
<code>B</code> is a vector of magnetic field abscissa
values over which the spectrum was calculated in units of mT.
<li>
<code>trans
</code> is a list of
level number pairs indicating the transitions which where included in
the spectrum calculations. Level numbers refer to the energy levels of
the Hamiltonian in ascending order, so level 1 is that which lowest
energy and so on. If <code>spec</code> is a matrix, <code>spec(k,:)</code>
is the spectrum of the transition <code>trans(k,:)</code>.
</ul>

<p>
There are three arguments to the function, the last one optional.
They are similar to those of the function <a class="esf" href="resfields.html">
resfields</a>.
</p>

<p>
<code>Sys</code> is a <a href="spinsystem.html">spin system structure</a>
containing spin Hamiltonian parameters and <a href="broadenings.html">line broadening parameters</a>.
</p>

<p>
For simulating a multi-component mixture, <code>Sys</code> should be a cell array of spin systems,
e.g. <code>{Sys1,Sys2}</code> for a two-component mixture. Each of the component spin systems should
have a field <code>weight</code> that specifies the weight of the corresponding component in the final
spectrum.
</p>

<p>
<code>Exp</code> contains experimental parameters such as the microwave
frequency, the magnetic field range and temperature. Here is a full
list of its fields:
</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" class="optionlist">

<tr><th><code>mwFreq</code></th><td>
Spectrometer frequency, in GHz. E.g. <code>Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;</code> for X band.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>CenterSweep</code></th><td>
<em>2-element vector</em> <code>[center sweep]</code><br>
Contains center field and sweep width of the
external magnetic field sweep range. Values should be in mT,
e.g. <code>Exp.CenterSweep=[310 100]</code>.
<p>
The magnetic field sweep range can be specified either in <code>CenterSweep</code>
or in <code>Range</code>. If both are given, <code>CenterSweep</code> has precedence.
</td></tr>


<tr><th><code>Range</code></th><td>
<em>2-element vector</em> <code>[loField hiField]</code><br>
Contains lower and upper limit of the
external magnetic field sweep range. Values should be in mT,
e.g. <code>Exp.Range=[260 360]</code>.

<p>
The magnetic field sweep range can be specified either in <code>CenterSweep</code>
or in <code>Range</code>. If both are given, <code>CenterSweep</code> has precedence.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>nPoints</code></th><td>
Number of points on the magnetic field abscissa axis. If not given,
the default is 1024.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>Temperature</code></th><td>
<em>scalar</em> (default <code>inf</code>) or <em>vector</em>
<p>
This field specifies populations
for the states of the spin system, either directly or via a temperature.
<p>
<em>Thermal equilibium:</em><br>
<code>Temperature</code> is the temperature of the spin system in the
EPR experiment, in Kelvin. If given, Boltzmann populations are computed
and included in the EPR line intensities. E.g., <code>Temperature = 298</code>
corresponds to room temperature. If not given (or set to <code>inf</code>),
all transitions are assumed to have equal polarizations.
<p>
<em>Non-equilibrium populations:</em><br>
<code>Temperature</code> can also be used to specify non-equilibrium populations.
For a spin system with <code>N</code> electron states (e.g. 4 for a biradical),
it must be a vector with <code>N</code> elements giving the
populations of the zero-field electron states, from lowest to highest in energy.
<br>
E.g., if <code>Temperature = [0.85 0.95 1.2]</code> for an S=1 system, the
population of the lowest-energy zero-field state is 0.85, and the highest-energy
zero-field state has a population of 1.2. The populations of all nuclear
sublevels within an electron spin manifold are assumed to be equal.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>Harmonic</code></th><td>
<code>0</code>, <code>1</code> (default) or <code>2</code><br>
Harmonic of the detection. <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> specify
the first and the second <em>derivative</em> of the absorption spectrum,
respectively. <code>0</code> returns the absorption spectrum without
differentiation.  To explicitly include
the effect of field modulation, use <code>Exp.ModAmp</code>.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>Mode</code></th><td>
<code>'perpendicular'</code> (default) or <code>'parallel'</code><br>
Relative orientation of the microwave field B<sub>1</sub> with respect to the static magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>. <code>'perpendicular'</code>
means <img src="eqn/pepper1.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH $B_1\perp B_0$-->.
<code>'parallel'</code> means that <img src="eqn/pepper2.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH $B_1 \| B_0$ -->.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>ModAmp</code></th><td>
Modulation amplitude (peak-to-peak), in mT.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>mwPhase</code></th><td>
The reference microwave phase, in radians. 0 is pure absorption (default value), and <code>pi/2</code> is pure dispersion. <code>mwPhase</code> is used only if the convolutional broadening given in <code>Sys.lw</code> or <code>Sys.lwpp</code> has a Lorentzian component.
<p><code>mwPhase</code> allows you to include absorption/dispersion admixture in the simulation.
</td></tr>


<tr><th><code>Orientations</code></th><td>
3xN array of real<br>
Specifies single-crystal orientations for which the EPR spectrum
should be computed. Each column of <code>Orientation</code>
contains the three Euler rotation angles <code>[phi;theta;chi]</code> of the
magnetic field in a molecule fixed frame. If <code>Orientation</code> is empty
or not specified, the full powder spectrum is computed.
<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Orientations = [0;0;0];              % crystal with z axis aligned with B0
Exp.Orientations = [0;pi/2;0];           % crystal with z axis perpendicular to B0
Exp.Orientations = [0 0 0;0 pi/2 0].';   % two orientations
Exp.Orientations = [];                   % powder
</pre>
</td></tr>


<tr><th><code>CrystalSymmetry</code></th><td>
<p>
Specifies the symmetry of the crystal, if single-crystal spectra to be simulated
(that is, if <code>Exp.Orientations</code> is specified). The crystal symmetry can
be either the number of the space group (between 1 and 230), the symbol of the
space group (e.g. <code>'P21212'</code> or the symbol for the point group
(e.g. <code>'C2h'</code> or <code>'2/m'</code>).
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'P21/m'; % space group symbol
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 11;      % space group number (between 1 and 230)
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'C2h';   % point group, Sch&ouml;nflies notation
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = '2/m';   % point group, Hermann-Mauguin notation
</pre>

<p>
When <code>CrystalSymmetry</code> is given, <code>pepper</code> automatically computes
the spectra of all symmetry-related sites in the crystal. If <code>CrystalSymmetry</code>
is not given, <code>pepper</code> assumes space group 1 (P1, point group C1), which has
only one site per unit cell.
</p>

</td></tr>


<tr><th><code>Ordering</code></th><td>
<em>scalar</em> (default: zero) or <em>function handle</em><br>
<p>
If a number is given in this field, it specifies the orientational distribution
of the paramagnetic molecules in the sample.

<p>If not given or set to zero,
the distribution is isotropic, i.e. all orientations occur with the same
probability. If it is given, the orientational distribution is non-isotropic
and computed according to the formula P(&theta;) = exp(&lambda;(3 cos<sup>2</sup>&theta; - 1)/2),
where &theta; is the angle between the molecular z axis and the static magnetic field, and
&lambda; is the number specified in <code>Exp.Ordering</code>.

<p>
Typical values for &lambda; are between about -20 and +20. For negative values, the orientational
distribution function is maximum at &theta; = 90&deg;, for positive values at &theta; = 0&deg; and &theta; = 180&deg;. The larger the magnitude of &lambda;, the sharper the
distributions.

<p>
To plot a distribution depending on &lambda;, use

<pre class="mlexample">
lambda = 5;
theta = linspace(0,pi,1001);
p = exp(lambda*plegendre(2,0,cos(theta)));
plot(theta*180/pi,p);
</pre>

<p>
If <code>Exp.Ordering</code> is a function handle, <code>pepper</code> will use the user-supplied
function to obtain the orientational distribution. It calls the function with two vector arguments, <code>phi</code>
and <code>theta</code> (in radians). The function must return a vector <code>P</code> containing probabilities for each
orientation, that is <code>P(k)</code> is the probability of finding the paramagnetic molecules with orientation
specified by <code>phi(k)</code> and <code>theta(k)</code>. Here is an example with an anonymous function:
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Ordering = @(phi,theta) gaussian(theta,0,15/180*pi);
</pre>

<p>
Of course, the function can also be written and stored in a separate file, e.g. <code>myori.m</code>. Then use <code>Exp.Ordering = @myori</code>.
</p>

<p>
When using a custom orientational distribution, make sure that the symmetry used in the simulation corresponds to the
symmetry of the distribution. If the distribution is very narrow, increase the number of knots in the options structure.
</p>

<p>
<code>mwFreq</code> and <code>Range</code> have to be provided by the user,
all other fields are optional and have default values.
</p>

<p>
The structure <code>Opt</code> collects computational parameters.
<code>Opt</code> need not be specified, in which case default values
for all fields are used. The field names and their possible values are
listed below.
</p>


<table border="1" class="optionlist">


<tr><th><code>Verbosity</code></th><td>
Determines how much information <code>pepper</code> prints to the screen.
If <code>Opt.Verbosity=0</code>, <code>pepper</code> is completely silent.
1 logs relevant information, 2 gives more details.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>Output</code></th><td>
<code>'summed'</code> (default) or <code>'separate'</code><br>
Determines in what form the spectrum is returned. If set to <code>'separate'</code>,
<code>pepper</code> returns one spectrum for each transition in a matrix
<code>spec</code>. The transition spectra are along the rows. <code>spec(k,:)</code>
is the spectrum of transition k.
If <code>'summed'</code> is specified, the total spectrum is
returned in <code>spec</code> as a vector.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>nKnots</code></th><td>
<code>[N1]</code> or <code>[N1 N2]</code>
<br>
Determines the number of orientations (knots) in a powder simulation for which
spectra are calculated.

<ul>
<li>
<code>N1</code> gives the number of orientations between &theta;=0° and &theta;=90°
for which spectra are explicitely calculated using the physical theory.
Common values for <code>N1</code> are between 10 (10° increments) and 91 (1° increments).
The larger the anisotropy of the spectrum and the narrower the linewidth, the higher
<code>N1</code> must be to yield smooth powder spectra.

<li><code>N2</code> is the refinement factor for the interpolation of the orientational
grid. E.g. if <code>N2=4</code>, then between each pair of computed orientations
three additional orientations are calculated by spline interpolation. Values higher than 10
are rarely necessary. If <code>N2</code> is not given, a default value is used.
</ul>

<pre class="mlexample">
Opt.nKnots = 91;       % 1° increments, no interpolation
Opt.nKnots = [46 0];   % 2° increments, no interpolation
Opt.nKnots = [31 6];   % 3° increments, 6-fold interpolation (giving 0.5° increments)
</pre>
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>Symmetry</code></th><td>
<code>'auto'</code> (default), <code>'Dinfh'</code>, <code>'D2h'</code>,
<code>'C2h'</code> or <code>'Ci'</code>
<br>
Determines the symmetry used for the powder simulation. Based on this
the set of orientations for which spectra are computed is chosen.
<code>'Dinfh'</code> corresponds to a line from &theta;=0° to &theta=90° (with
&phi;=0°), <code>'D2h'</code> to one octant, <code>'C2h'</code> to two octants,
and <code>'Ci'</code> to one hemisphere (four octants).
<code>auto</code> is the default,
meaning that <code>pepper</code> determines the correct symmetry
automatically from the given spin system. With any other setting, <code>pepper</code> is forced into
using the specified symmetry, even if it is incorrect for the spin system.
See also <a class="esf" href="symm.html">symm</a>.

</td></tr>
<tr><th><code>Transitions</code></th><td>
<em>mx2 vector of integers</em>
<br>
Determines manually the level pairs which are used in the spectrum
calculation. If given, <code>pepper</code> uses them and skips its
automatic transition selection scheme. Level pairs are specified in
<code>Transitions(k,:)</code> by the level numbers which start with
1 for the lowest-energy level.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Threshold</code></td><td>
Specifies the threshold for <code>pepper</code>'s transition pre-selection. Any
transition with an estimated relative average amplitude less than this number is
not included in the calculation. The relative average amplitude of the
strongest transition is 1, the default is <code>1e-4</code>. The pre-selection is
an approximate procedure, and it might miss transitions for complicated spin systems.
In these cases, setting it to zero will include all transitions in the computation.
</td></tr>


<tr><th><code>Intensity</code></th><td>
<code>'on'</code> (default) or <code>'off'</code>
<br>
With <code>'on'</code>, transition rates, i.e. line intensities, are computed
correctly. Allowed transitions will be more intense then quasi-forbidden ones.
<code>'off'</code> simply sets all transition rates of all transitions to 1.
Allowed and forbidden transitions will have the same intensity.
Be very careful when switching this option to <code>'off'</code>!
The resulting spectra are not correct.
</td></tr>

<tr><th><code>
Method
</code></th><td>
<code>'matrix'</code> (default), <code>'perturb'</code>, <code>'perturb1'</code>, <code>'perturb2'</code>, <code>'hybrid'</code>
<p>
Determines how <code>pepper</code> computes the resonance fields.
<ul>
<li>
<code>'matrix'</code> indicates matrix diagonalization. This method is
very reliable and accurate and works for spin systems with any number of
spins. All interactions, including quadrupole, are included in the computation.
<li>
<code>'perturb1'</code> indicates first-order perturbation theory, and 
<code>'perturb'</code> or <code>'perturb2'</code> indicates second-order perturbation theory.
These methods ares limited to spin systems with one electron spin 1/2 (and possibly some nuclei).
In addition, nuclear Zeeman and nuclear quadrupole terms are neglected, and only
allowed transitions are computed. The resulting spectrum is reasonably correct only
for small hyperfine couplings (e.g. organic radicals).
<li>
<code>'hybrid'</code> indicates matrix diagonalization for all the electron spins, and perturbation treatment for all nuclei, using effective nuclear sub-Hamiltonians for each electron spin manifold.
</ul>
<code>'matrix'</code> is the method of choice for systems with only a few low-spin nuclei (and any number of electron spins). For spin systems with many nuclei and small hyperfine couplings, simulations using perturbation theory are orders of magnitude faster.

<p>
<code>'hybrid'</code> is the method of choice for systems with several large electron spins coupled to several nuclei such as in oligometallic clusters.

<tr><td><code>Freq2Field</code></td><td>
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (default)

Determines the order of the frequency-to-field conversion.

conversion with the generalised 1/g factor <img src="eqn/pepper3.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH $(\partial(E_v-E_u)/\partial B)^{-1}$ -->

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle">Algorithm</div>

<p>
Spectra are calculated over a triangular orientational grid using
<a class="esf" href="resfields.html">resfields</a> to obtain the resonance field positions and amplitudes.
For each orientation line positions, and possibly widths and
intensities, are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
This gridded data is then interpolated with cubic splines in a
combined 1D/2D approach. Resampling of the spline surface gives much
quicker many more position/intensity/width data than
quantum-mechanical calculation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the refined data are projected onto the magnetic field axis
using a Delaunay triangulation of the resampled spline surfaces.
Linear interpolative projection of these triangles yields an extremely
smooth spectrum with very low powder simulation noise. In the case of
full anisotropic width treatment, a simple sum-up of Gaussian line shapes
is used instead of the projection.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the main steps above, there is an automatic transition
selection, which works along the same line as the overall algorithm,
except that its results are only used for determining which level
pairs possibly contribute to the spectrum.
</p>

<p>
For line width calculations, Gaussian distributions are assumed both in the
magnetic field and the frequency dimension. The overall line width for a given
orientation is
</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="eqn/pepper4.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH

where <img src="eqn/pepper5.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH$\varGamma_\mr{res}$--> is the residual line width
specified in <code>Sys.HStrain</code>, <img src="eqn/pepper6.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH$\varGamma_{gA}$--> is
the line width due to correlated g-A strain (<code>Sys.gStrain</code> and <code>Sys.AStrain</code>),
and <img src="eqn/pepper7.png" alt="[eqn]"><!--MATH$\varGamma_{DE}$--> the width arising from D-E strain
(<code>Sys.DStrain</code>).
</p>

<p>
Although quite robust and general, <code>pepper</code> still has some
limitations.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
In the case of looping resonance fields, interpolation is not possible. If
the spectrum is coarse, increase <code>Opt.nKnots</code>.
</li>
<li>
In the case of looping resonance fields, there might appear bumps around the
coalescence points in the spectrum. To get rid of them, increase the line widths
or <code>Opt.nKnots</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="subtitle">Examples</div>

<p>
As an illustration, we explore the influence of various <code>pepper</code>
options on the zeroth-harmonic (DC) spectrum of a simple orthorhombic system.
First the spin system, the experiment at X-band and some options are
defined. An anisotropic line width is included in the spin system.

<p>
Next we compute spectra for some combinations of broadening parameters.
