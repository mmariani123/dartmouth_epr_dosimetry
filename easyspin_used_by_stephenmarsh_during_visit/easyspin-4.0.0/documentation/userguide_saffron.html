<div class="subtitle"><a name="calling">Invoking the simulation function saffron</a></div>

<p>
Solid-state pulse EPR spectra of powders and single crystals are computed
by the EasySpin function <a class="esf" href="saffron.html">saffron</a>.
It can be called with two or three parameters. For example,
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
saffron(Sys,Exp);                       % plots the spectrum
[frq,spec] = saffron(Sys,Exp);          % returns the frequency axis and the spectrum
[frq,spec] = salt(Sys,Exp,Opt);      % provide additional simulation options in Opt
</pre>

<p>
The first argument <code>Sys</code> tells <code>salt</code> all about the
<a href="spinsystem.html">spin system</a>, and the second argument <code>Exp</code>
gives the experimental parameters. The third, optional, argument <code>Opt</code> 
contains settings for the simulation itself.
</p>

<p>
The outputs <code>frq</code> and <code>spec</code> are arrays containing the frequency values (in MHz)
and the spectrum, respectively. If no output is requested, <code>salt</code> plots the spectrum.
</p>

<p>
Setting up a simulation and running it takes only a few lines of code. A simple example is
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Sys.g = 2; Sys.Nucs = '1H'; Sys.A = [-1 2]*3+1; Sys.lwEndor = 0.1;
Exp.mwFreq = 9.8; Exp.Field = 350.1; Exp.Range = [0 30];
salt(Sys,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
This simulates and plots the powder <sup>1</sup>H ENDOR spectrum of a system with an unpaired electron and a proton.
Copy and paste the code above to your MATLAB command window to see the graph.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="spinsys">The spin system</a></div>

<p>
The first input argument to <code>salt</code> is a structure specifying
the <a href="spinsystem.html">spin system</a>.
It contains fields for the electron spin(s), the nuclear spins,
and the various interaction matrices like g and hyperfine tensors.
</p>

<p>
The fields in this structure are the same as used for cw EPR simulations with
<code>pepper</code>. See the <a href="tutorial_pepper.html">tutorial</a>
for <code>pepper</code> for an introduction. Details about all the spin Hamiltonian
parameters can be found on the <a href="hamiltonian.html">spin Hamiltonian reference page</a>.
It is also possible to include several electron spins. Refer to the
page about <a href="spinsystem.html">spin system structures</a> for details.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="broadenings">Broadenings</a></div>

<p>
The broadening for the ENDOR spectrum should be given in <code>Sys.lwEndor</code>. It contains
the convolutional Gaussian and Lorentzian broadenings for the ENDOR spectrum. 

<pre class="mlexample">
Sys.lwEndor = 0.1;        % Gaussian broadening with FWHM of 0.1 MHz
Sys.lwEndor = [0 0.2];    % Lorentzian broadening with FWHM of 0.2 MHz
Sys.lwEndor = [0.1 0.2];  % both broadenings simultaneously
</pre>

<p>
The only EPR line broadening used in an ENDOR simulation is <code>HStrain</code>: it co-determines
the effective excitation width.
Strain broadenings (<code>gStrain</code>, <code>AStrain</code> and <code>DStrain</code>) as well as
convolutional broadenings of the EPR spectrum (<code>lw</code> and <code>lwpp</code>) are ignored.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="expparams">Basic experimental settings</a></div>

<p>
All experimental settings are given in the second input argument <code>Exp</code>,
a structure with several fields very similar to those for <code>pepper</code>.
</p>

<p>
The most important parameter for an ENDOR simulation is the magnetic field. It is
given in <code>Exp.Field</code>, in the usual units of mT (millitesla):

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Field = 350;    % ENDOR at a field of 350 mT
</pre>

<p>
The spectrometer frequency is given in the field <code>mwFreq</code> in units of GHz (gigahertz). 
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.mwFreq = 9.612;     % in GHz
</pre>

<p>
The sweep range of the radiofrequency, in MHz, is taken from the field <code>Range</code>
(which is used by <code>pepper</code> for the <em>magnetic field</em> range).

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Range = [0 30];   % rf sweep range, in MHz
</pre>

<p>
By default, <code>salt</code> computes a 1024-point spectrum. However, the number of
points can be changed manually to a different value, e.g.,
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.nPoints = 5001;
</pre>

<p>
By default, <code>salt</code> computes the absorption spectrum. By changing <code>Exp.Harmonic</code>, the first-harmonic
(first-derivative) or the second-harmonic (second derivative) of it can be requested.
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Harmonic = 0; % absorption spectrum (default)
Exp.Harmonic = 1; % first harmonic
Exp.Harmonic = 2; % second harmonic
</pre>


<p>
The polarizing effects of low sample temperatures can also be included in the
simulation by specifying the temperature:
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Temperature = 4.2; % temperature in Kelvin
</pre>

<p>
With this setting, <code>pepper</code> will include the relevant polarization
factors resulting from a thermal equilibrium population of the energy levels.
However, there are only very few situations where temperature effects are
visible in ENDOR spectra.
</p>

<p>
There is one more experimental parameter for an ENDOR simulation: the excitation
width, given in <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code>. It determines the orientational
selectivity of the ENDOR experiment. It is so important that we dedicate the
next section to it.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="customsequences">Custom pulse sequences</a></div>

<p>
<code>saffron</code> does not limit you to the few pre-defined pulse sequences. With a few
simple input lines, you can specify any custom 1D or 2D pulse sequence and simulate the corresponding time traces
and spectra.

<p>
For defining a new pulse experiment, several fields have to be given in <code>Exp</code>, and
several others are optional. The most important fields are

<ul>
<li><code>Exp.Flip</code>: pulse flip angles, in multiples of 90°
<li><code>Exp.Inc</code>: incrementation dimension and direction
<li><code>Exp.t</code>: initial delays, in microseconds
</ul>

<p>
More advanced fields are
<ul>
<li><code>Exp.Phase</code>: pulse phases, in multiples of 90°
<li><code>Exp.tp</code>: pulse lengths, in microseconds
<li><code>Exp.Filter</code>: coherence filter, for phase cycling
</ul>

Let us look at a simple example, the two-pulse ESEEM experiment. It is defined by

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Flip = [1 2];     % 90°, 180°
Exp.Inc = [1 1];      % increment both delays along the first dimension
Exp.t = [1 1]*0.100;  % starting tau value
</pre>

There are two pulses, so <code>Exp.Flip</code> has two entries, one for each pulse, specifying the flip angle in multiples of 90°.
The first pulse is a 90° pulse, and the second pulse is a 180° pulse. Next, in <code>Exp.Inc</code> there is one entry for each
delay between pulses

Another example is HYSCORE, which is simply defined as

<pre class="mlexample">
tau = 0.100; t0 = 0.080;
Exp.Flip = [1 1 2 1];     % 90°, 90°, 180°, 90°
Exp.Inc = [0 1 2 0];      % increment 2nd delay along 1st dimension, and 3rd delay along 2nd dimension
Exp.t = [tau t0 t0 tau];  % tau value and start times for the incremented delays
</pre>

All pulses are assumed to have y phase, so that the echo occurs along x or -x, for any pulse sequence. But if needed, you can set the phase
of each pulse manually in the field <code>Exp.Phase</code>, again in multiples of 90°. x corresponds to 0°, y to 90°, -x to 180° and -y to 270°.

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Phase = [1 1 0]; % pulses with phases y, y, and x
</pre>


<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="oriselect">Orientation selection</a></div>

<p>
In a pulse EPR experiment of a disordered system, not all paramagnetic centers are excited.
Only those that resonate at the given magnetic field <em>and</em> microwave frequency
can give an ENDOR signal. Spins that are slightly off-resonant contribute less, and spins
far off-resonant cannot give an ENDOR signal at all. If the EPR resonance frequency is orientation
dependent, this means that only electron spins with certain orientations are excited - hence the
term "orientation selection". The range of frequencies over which electron spins are excited is
called the "excitation window". It is centered around the microwave frequency.

<p>
The bandwidth of excitation, i.e. the width of the excitation window and consequently what fraction
of all spins participates in the pulse experiment, is determined by the length of the first pulse.

<p>
There are two ways to include this orientation selection in your simulations, one for ideal pulses and one
for real pulses.

<p>
Let's look at the case of ideal pulses first, which is simpler. If you don't specify <code>Exp.tp</code>
pulses are assumed infinitely short and strong and theoretically excite all spins, no matter how far
off-resonant they are. To correct for the fact that the pulses are actually finite in length and that
not all spins are excited, a simple Gaussian excitation window centered around the microwave frequency
is assumed. You can specify its FWHM width (the excitation bandwidth) in <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code>,
in units of MHz. Values between 10 and 250 MHz are common. The smaller this value, the stronger the orientation
selection, and the sharper the lines in the resulting spectra. The excitation bandwidth can be estimated
from the length of the first pulse, t<sub>p</sub>, by 2/t<sub>p</sub>. For a 20ns pulse, set <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code>
to about 100 MHz.

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.ExciteWidth = 100;   % in MHz, approx. corresponds to a 20 ns first pulse
</pre>

<p>
If <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code> is not given, it is assumed infiniite, that is, all the spins are excited.
This is rather unrealistic, but often useful when exploring spectra resulting from different sets of hyperfine
and quadrupole parameters.

<p>
To compute the total effective excitation width for the ENDOR experiment, EasySpin combines the
width given in <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code> with the width given in <code>Sys.HStrain</code>,
which represents the EPR broadening. The larger <code>HStrain</code>, the larger the
total excitation bandwidth.

<pre class="mlexample">
Sys.HStrain = [1 1 1]*200;
Exp.ExciteWidth = 20;    % total excitation width in MHz: sqrt(200^2+20^2) = 201
Exp.ExciteWidth = 50;    % total excitation width in MHz: sqrt(200^2+50^2) = 206
Exp.ExciteWidth = 100;   % total excitation width in MHz: sqrt(200^2+100^2) = 224
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, the total excitation width is rather insensitive to <code>ExciteWidth</code>,
if <code>ExciteWidth</code> is much smaller than <code>HStrain</code>.


<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="crystals">Powders and crystals</a></div>

<p>
If not specified otherwise, <code>salt</code> computes a powder spectrum. But
it is as well straightforward to simulate spectra for a single crystal. The
orientation (or orientations if more than one) of the single crystal can be provided in the
experiment structure field <code>Exp.Orientations</code>. This field should
contain the <a href="eulerangles.html">tilt angles</a> between molecular and laboratory frame 
(right-handed coordinate system with z along the static
field and x along the microwave magnetic field), one set of three angles per
column.
</p>

<p>
For a crystal with its molecular frame aligned with the laboratory frame, the setting is 
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Orientations = [0;0;0];
</pre>

<p>
If you need more than one crystal at the same time, then just specify more than one orientation.
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Orientations = [0 0 0;0 pi/4 0].';
</pre>

<p>
In many crystals, there are several symmetry-related sites with identical paramagnetic centers
differing only in their orientation in the crystal. You can tell <code>salt</code> 
about this by providing the crystal symmetry in the field <code>Exp.CrystalSymmetry</code>, e.g.
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'P21/m'; % space group symbol
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 11;      % space group number (between 1 and 230)
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'C2h';   % point group, Sch&ouml;nflies notation
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = '2/m';   % point group, Hermann-Mauguin notation
</pre>

<p>
With the crystal symmetry given, <code>salt</code> not only computes the spectrum for the orientation
given in <code>Exp.Orientations</code>, but also for all symmetry-related sites.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="options">Simulation options</a></div>

<p>
The third input argument to <code>salt</code> contains simulation options.
All of them have reasonable default values, but occasionally it might be necessary
to change one of them.
</p>

<p>
If you want <code>salt</code> to print information about the simulation to
the command window during the computation, use
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Options = struct('Verbosity',1);
</pre>

<p>
<code>'Verbosity'</code> specifies the logging level. 0 (the default)
suppresses all output, 1 is normal logging, and 2 prints more information,
relevant only for debugging.
</p>

<p>
Another useful option is <code>nKnots</code>, which determines how many
orientations <code>salt</code> will include in the simulation of a powder
spectrum. If this value is too low, the spectrum shape contains ripples.
<code>nKnots</code> is the number of orientations between the z axis and
the x axis (between &theta; = 0 and &theta; = 90 degrees).
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Options.nKnots = 31; % corresponds to 3-degree increments
</pre>

<p>
The higher <code>nKnots</code>, the finer the orientational grid.
The default value of 19 (5-degree increments) is appropriate for most systems.
A value larger than 181 (0.5-degree increments) is rarely needed.
</p>

<p>
After having computed the spectrum for a number of orientations specified
by <code>nKnots</code>, the simulation function interpolates these spectra for
additional orientations before summing up all spectra. This interpolative
refinement can be configured with a second number in <code>nKnots</code>.
<code>nKnots = [19 4]</code> means that <code>pepper</code> interpolates
additional 4 spectra between two adjacent orientations evaluated.
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Options.nKnots = [19 10];  % massive interpolation
Options.nKnots = [19 0];   % no interpolation
</pre>

<p>
The option <code>Output</code> can be used to determine the form in which
<code>salt</code> returns the spectral data.
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
% single crystal: orientations separately
% powders: transitions separately
Options.Output = 'separate';

% sum over all orientations and transitions
Options.Output = 'summed';
</pre>

<p>
There are more option fields available. For details, see the reference page
on <a class="esf" href="salt.html">salt</a>.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="speedups">Simulation speed-ups</a></div>

<p>
By default, EasySpin uses matrix diagonalization for computing ENDOR spectra.
Even though this is by far the most accurate way, it is also the slowest. This
can be felt painfully when simulating ENDOR spectra of spin systems with a lot
of nuclei. EasySpin offers several speed-up options to trade a little accuracy for a lot
in performance gain.

<p>
One way to speed up an ENDOR simulation is to switch to first-order perturbation theory.

<pre class="mlexample">
Options.Method = 'perturb';   % first-order perturbation theory
Options.Method = 'matrix';    % matrix diagonalization
</pre>

<p>
If you have a few protons in an 1H ENDOR spectrum, perturbation theory is orders of
magnitude faster than matrix diagonalization. Under most circumstances, the errors
introduced are minimal. Perturbation theory does not work for all spin systems: it
is limited to S=1/2 and spin-1/2 nuclei.

<p>
Another way to speed up simulations is useful when there is strong orientation selection,
and only nuclei with small hyperfine couplings are observed in the ENDOR spectrum. <code>salt</code>
can be told to pre-compute the orientation selection instead of computing it on the fly, using

<pre class="mlexample">
Options.OriPreSelect = 1; % use orientation pre-selection
</pre>

<p>
This tells EasySpin to classify nuclei into whether they contribute to orientation selection (N1)
or not (N2), then pre-compute orientation selection data only for those in group N1. Any orientation
that is not noticeably excited is then skipped in the subsequent ENDOR simulation. This pre-selection
is advantageous only if there are several nuclei that do <code>not</code> contribute to orientational
selectivity.
