<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="esfit">The fitting function</a></div>

<p>
EasySpin's fitting function is <a class="esf" href="esfit.html">esfit</a> and can be called with up to seven parameters:

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp)
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp,SimOpt)
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp,SimOpt,FitOpt)
</pre>

Here is what the various parameters mean

<ul>
<li>
<code>'pepper'</code> indicates that the simulation function <a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a> is to be used. Any other simulation function, e.g. <code>'garlic'</code> or <code>'chili'</code>, can be given here.
<li>
<code>spc</code> is the array of experimental spectral data. For the fitting, the magnetic field values are not needed.
<li>
<code>Sys0</code> is a structure collecting magnetic parameters of the spin system. The parameters in this structure are used as first guesses in the fitting procedure. For a multi-component fit, this is a list of spin systems, one for each component.
<li>
<code>Vary</code> is a structure similar to <code>Sys0</code> containing 
the search ranges of the parameters that should be fitted. For a multi-component fit, this is again a list of structures, one for each component.
<li>
<code>Exp</code> is a structure containing the experimental parameters for the simulation function.
</ul>

The two following parameters can be omitted

<ul>
<li>
<code>SimOpt</code> contains setting for the spectral simulation function.
<li>
<code>FitOpt</code> contains settings for the least-squares fitting function.
</ul>

The next few sections explain how to set up these input parameters
so that <a class="esf" href="esfit.html">esfit</a> can be called.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="load">Loading the experimental spectrum</a></div>

<p>
Before you can fit parameters to your experimental spectrum, you have to import the data into MATLAB. There are several ways to do this, depending in which format your data are stored in.
</p>

<p>
If your spectrum was acquired by a Bruker spectrometer, it is most
likely either in ESP format (having file extensions .par and .spc)
or in BES3T format (with file extensions .DSC and .DTA). Both formats
are handled by EasySpin's function <a class="esf" href="eprload.html">eprload</a>. Here is an example: Suppose your data are stored in the files <code>dpph.DSC</code> and <code>dpph.DTA</code>. To load them
into MATLAB, type

<pre class="mlexample">
[spc,Params,B] = eprload('dpph.DTA');
</pre>

<p>
This returns the spectral data in <code>spc</code>, all the parameters
stored in the files are in the structure <code>Params</code>, and <code>B</code> contains the magnetic field values.
</p>

<p>
Often, experimental spectral data come in text files, containing
two columns of data, where the first column is the magnetic
field and the second column contains the spectral intensity.
To load such a file into MATLAB, use the function <code>textread</code>:

<pre class="mlexample">
[B,spc] = textread('dpph.txt','%f %f');
</pre>

<p>
<code>textread</code> is a very flexible function that can accomodate
many different text file formats. E.g. it can skip header lines if told to do so, it can accomodate comment lines, etc. See the MATLAB documentation for more details.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="startsys">Start set of parameters</a></div>

<p>
The fitting function needs to know where to start looking for
an optimal fit. This starting point is given as a spin system in the third input parameter to <code>esfit</code>. For example, if the spectrum is that of a simple S=1/2 with rhombic g and an isotropic linewidth, one would start with

<pre class="mlexample">
Sys0.g = [1.99, 2.07, 2.11];
Sys0.lw = 1;
</pre>

<p>
Some algorithms use this set of parameters as the start set, but other use it only to specify the center of the search range.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="vary">Parameter search range</a></div>

<p>
Next, <code>esfit</code> has to be told what parameters of the spin system given in <code>Sys0</code> should be fitted, and by how much the can be varied during the least-squares fitting.

<p>
This information is given in the fourth input parameter to <code>esfit</code>. If only the linewidth should be fitted, and it should be varied by approximately +-0.3 mT, use

<pre class="mlexample">
Vary.lw = 0.3;
</pre>

<p>
If the second principal value of the g tensor and the linewidth should be fitted simultaneously, use

<pre class="mlexample">
Vary.g = [0 0.02 0];
Vary.lw = 0.3;
</pre>

<p>
In essence, all the fields in <code>Vary</code> must have the same names as those in <code>Sys0</code>, and any non-zero value indicates that that parameter should be fitted by varying it approximately by plus minus the given amount. Zero values for any parameter exclude it from the fitting.

<p>
It is advisable not to vary more than about 4 parameters at the same time, as the efficiency of the fitting algorithms decreases with the number of fitting parameters.

<p>
A special note for fitting slow-motion EPR spectra with <a class="esf" href="chili.html">chili</a>: Do not use <code>tcorr</code> or <code>Diff</code> for fitting the correlation time or the diffusion tensor, but rather the logarithmic forms <code>logtcorr</code> and <code>logDiff</code>.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="params">Experimental parameters</a></div>

<p>
Of course, the fitting function must also be provided with the experimental parameters for the spectral simulations. These are given as the fifth parameter, a structure <code>Exp</code> which is directly forwarded to the simulation functions
<a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a>, 
<a class="esf" href="garlic.html">garlic</a>, or
<a class="esf" href="chili.html">chili</a>. For details, see the documentation of these functions.

<p>
A minimal example would be

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.mwFreq = 9.5;
Exp.Range = [200 400];
</pre>

<p>
The micrwave frequency, the field range and all other experimental parameters must correspond to the ones used in acquiring the spectral data.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="run">Performing the least-squares fitting</a></div>

<p>
Now we are all set to call the fitting function:

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
The least-squares fitting is started, and a figure window pops up that displays the experimental spectrum and the current and best fits so far. In addition, information about the fitting is also displayed in the command window.

<p>
When the fitting terminates (which we discuss further down), <code>esfit</code> prints the results
to the command window. If <code>esfit</code> is called with an output parameter

<pre class="mlexample">
result = esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp);
</pre>

<p>
it returns the results of the fitting in <code>result</code>.

<p>
If you want to pass settings to the simulation function, collect them in an additional stucture <code>SimOpt</code> and pass them as
sixth parameter:

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp,SimOpt);
</pre>

<p>
It is possible to provide a structure with settings for the fitting function. If we call this structure <code>FitOpt</code>, the syntax is

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spc,Sys0,Vary,Exp,SimOpt,FitOpt);
</pre>

<p>
The possible settings set in this last structure are the topic of the rest of this tutorial.


<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="method">Fitting methods</a></div>

<p>
The performance of the fitting depends crucially on two things: the choice of the optimization algorithm
and the choice of the target function. Let's have a look at each of them in turn.

<p>
EasySpin provides optimization algorithms that are in widespread use: (1) the Nelder/Mead downhill simplex method, (2) the Levenberg/Marquardt algorithm,
(3) Monte Carlo random search, (4) a genetic algorithm, and (5) a systematic grid search.

<p>
The first two are local search algorithms, which start from a
given starting set of parameters and try to work their way down a nearby valley of the parameter space to find the minimum.
Both methods are quite fast, although there are some differences in general performance between them: The downhill simplex
is somewhat slower than Levenberg/Marquardt, but it is more robust in the sense that it does not get stuck in a local minimum
as easily as Levenberg/Marquardt.
</p>

<p>
The latter three are global search methods: they do not have a single starting parameter set, but use many, distributed over the entire parameter search space.
The Monte Carlo method simply performs a series of random trial simulations and picks the best one. It is very inefficient. The systematic grid search is better:
It covers the parameter space with a grid and then does simulations for each knot of the grid, in random order. Thus, no point is simulated twice, and the
method is more efficient than the Monte Carlo search. However, if the minimum is between two grid points, it will never be found.
</p>

<p>
The third global method is a genetic algorithm: It makes simulations for several, let's say N, parameter sets (called a population), computes the fitting
error for all of them (called the fitness) and then proceeds to generate N new parameter sets from the old ones using mechansims like mutation, cross-over
and reproduction. This way, a new generation of parameter sets is (pro-)created, just like in biological evolution. The benefit of this algorithm is that
if a good parameter is encountered, it is likely to propagate down the generations and across the population.
</p>

<p>
To select one of the algorithms, specify it in the <code>Method</code> field of the fitting options
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
FitOpt.Method = 'simplex';     % for Nelder/Mead downhill simplex
FitOpt.Method = 'levmar';      % for Levenberg/Marquardt
FitOpt.Method = 'montecarlo';  % for Monte Carlo
FitOpt.Method = 'genetic';     % for the genetic algorithm
FitOpt.Method = 'grid';        % for grid search
</pre>

<p>
and then supply this options structure as seventh parameter to the fitting function, for example
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spec,Sys0,Vary,Exper,[],FitOpt);
</pre>

<p>
If you don't specify the algorithm, EasySpin uses the downhill simplex by default.
</p>

<p>
The second important setting is the choice of the target function. <code>esfit</code> computes the error
of the simulated spectrum using the root-mean-square-deviation (rmsd, ie the square root of the mean of the square of
the deviations), where the deviation is the difference between the experimental and the simulated spectrum.

<p>
Fitting speed can often by signifantly increased, however, if one used not the spectra directly, but their integrals
or similar transforms. EasySpin supports several settings here <code>'fcn'</code> (use spectrum as is), <code>'int'</code>
(integral), <code>'dint'</code> (double integral), <code>'diff'</code> (first derivative), <code>'fft'</code> (Fourier
transform). The setting string is simply appended to the <code>'Method'</code> field, after a space:

<pre class="mlexample">
FitOpt.Method = 'simplex int';   % simplex algorithm with integrals for rmsd
FitOpt.Method = 'genetic fcn';   % genetic algorithm with spectra as is
FitOpt.Method = 'levmar dint';   % Levenberg/Marquardt with double integral
</pre>

<p>
Usually, <code>'fcn'</code> is an excellent choice, but in the case of many lines <code>'int'</code> is much better - provided
the baseline in the experimental spectrum is good. The other settings (<code>'dint'</code>, <code>'diff'</code>, and <code>'fft'</code>)
do not have general applicability.
</p>



<p>
Each algorithm has some internal parameters that can be used to fine-tune its performance.
In general, it is not necessary to fiddle with those parameters at all. For more details, see the documentation of
<a class="esf" href="esfit.html">esfit</a>.
</p>


<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="settings">Other settings</a></div>


<p>
Normally, EasySpin just scales the simulated spectrum in a way that the the maximum absolute value coincides with the maximum
absolute value of the experimental spectrum. However, if the experimental spectrum is very noisy, this is not ideal, and the
best scaling of simulated spectrum is better determined by least-squares fitting. The scaling method can be set in the field
<code>FitOpt.Scaling</code>. The most common settings are

<pre class="mlexample">
FitOpt.Scaling = 'maxabs';    % scaling so that the maximum absolute values coincide
FitOpt.Scaling = 'lsq';       % determine scaling via least-squares fitting
</pre>

<p>
A simple mock example of this would be

<pre class="mlexample">
Sys.g = 2; Sys.lw = 2; Exp.mwFreq = 9.5; Exp.Range = [335 345];
[x,y] = pepper(Sys,Exp); y = 3*addnoise(y,2);
Sys.g = 2.001; Sys.lw = 1.8; Vary.g = 0.002; Vary.lw = 0.4;
FitOpt.Scaling = 'maxabs';
esfit('pepper',y,Sys,Vary,Exp,[],FitOpt);
</pre>

<p>
Change <code>FitOpt.Scaling</code> to see how the two scaling methods differ. For other scaling methods, see the documentation
of <a class="esf" href="esfit.html">esfit</a>.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="hybrid">Hybrid methods</a></div>

<p>
With EasySpin it is easily possible to perform so-called hybrid least-squares fittings, where one optimization algorithm is used to locate a potential minimum, and another one is used to refine the parameters at that minimum. The first of these two steps often employs algorithms that are able to locate minima globally and do not get stuck easily in a local minimum.
The disadvantage of these methods is that they are often slow. The second step closes in on the minimum by using a much faster local method. There
are two ways to perform such a two-stage fitting: using the graphical interface, or writing your own code.
</p>

<p>
If one of the global methods (Monte Carlo, grid search, or genetic algorithm) is used, the graphical plot during the execution of
<code>esfit</code> contains a button labelled <em>local</em>. Whenever that button is pressed, EasySpin takes the current best
parameter set and performs a simplex minimization. Once that is done, it goes back and continues with the global search. This way,
you can decide to narrow down a minimum whenever you think the global search has produced a parameter set that could be close to one.

<p>
Alternatively, you can write code that does two- or multistage fitting. Let's look at an example with a two-stage fitting using genetic
algorithm followed by Levenberg/Marquardt. This can be set up by calling <code>esfit</code> twice with different settings in <code>FitOpt</code>.

<pre class="mlexample">
% first stage: genetic algorithm
FitOpt.Method = 'genetic fcn';
Sys1 = esfit('pepper',y,Sys0,Vary,Exp,[],FitOpt);

% second stage: Levenberg/Marquardt
FitOpt.Method = 'levmar int';
Sys2 = esfit('pepper',y,Sys1,Vary,Exp,[],FitOpt)
</pre>

<p>
Of course, you'll probably have to change some of the termination criteria for the two algorithms so that the genetic search narrows
down a minimu only coarsely, and the local search can then much more efficiently finalize the fit by refining the parameters.

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="stop">Termination criteria</a></div>

<p>
<code>esfit</code> stops the fitting when it thinks it has reached a minimum in the error function, when it has taken more
than a given amount of time, if the set number of simulations are reached, or if the user interrupts it.
Let's have a look at these possibilities in turn.

<p>
<code>esfit</code> considers a local least-squares fit using the simplex or the Levenberg/Marquardt algorithm to be converged
if the change in parameters from one simulation iteration to the next falls below a certain threshold and/or if
the change in the error from iteration to iteration falls below another threshold.  Both thresholds have pre-set 
values, but can be adjusted by supplying appropriate fields in the <code>FitOpt</code> structure:

<pre class="mlexample">
FitOpt.TolFun = 1e-3;    % termination tolerance for error change
FitOpt.TolStep = 1e-3;   % termination tolerance for parameter step
</pre>

<p>
The global methods terminate also if the maximum number of simulations are reached: the Monte Carlo search does only a pre-set
number of simulations (<code>FitOpt.N</code>), the grid search stops if all the grid points are simulated (see the option
<code>FitOpt.GridSize</code>), and the genetic algorithm stops at the latest after a certain number of generations (see
<code>FitOpt.PopulationSize</code> and <code>FitOpt.Generations</code>).

<p>
In a field <code>FitOpt.maxTime</code>, the fitting function can be told to terminate after a given amount of time, even if the
fitting did not converge in terms of <code>TolStep</code> and <code>TolFun</code>.
This can be useful when running several fittings overnight from a script.

<pre class="mlexample">
FitOpt.maxTime = 60;     % maximum time, in minutes
</pre>

<p>
Yet another way to terminate the fitting requires that the graphical display is on. In the figure window, there is a button
labelled "stop". <code>esfit</code> terminates, when this button is pressed
and returns the best fit so far.


<!-- ============================================================= -->
<div class="subtitle"><a name="multicomp">Multiple components</a></div>
<p>
So far we have looked at the fitting of a spectrum with a single spectral component. EasySpin can least-squares fit spectra with multiple components. For each component, a system structure and a variation structure must be given. For example, this is how <code>esfit</code> is called for a two-component fit:

<pre class="mlexample">
esfit('pepper',spc,{Sys1,Sys2},{Vary1,Vary2},Exp,SimOpt,FitOpt);
</pre>

Each spin system (<code>Sys1</code> and <code>Sys2</code>) contain the magnetic parameters, and the corresponding variation structures (<code>Vary1</code> for <code>Sys1</code>, and <code>Vary2</code> for <code>Sys2</code>) contain the parameters to be varied.

<p>
In addition, the weight of each spin system has to be given in the field <code>weight</code>:
<pre class="mlexample">
Sys1.weight = 0.8;
Sys2.weight = 0.4;
</pre>
The weights need not add up to 1. They can even be included in the fit, for example:

<pre class="mlexample">
Vary1.weight = 0.3;
</pre>
