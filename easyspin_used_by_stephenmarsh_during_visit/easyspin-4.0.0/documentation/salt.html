<div class="subtitle">Description</div>

<p>
This function calculates powder and single-crystal ENDOR spectra. Its calling syntax
is identical to that of <a class="esf" href="pepper.html">pepper</a>, many of its options
are equal to those of <a class="esf" href="endorfrq.html">endorfrq</a>, which is used by
<code>salt</code> to compute line positions and amplitudes.
</p>

<p>
There are up to three output arguments
</p>

<ul>
<li>If no output arguments are requested, <code>salt</code> plots the simulated spectrum.
<li>
<code>rf</code> is the vector of radiofrequency values in MHz over which the
spectrum was calculated.
<li>
<code>spec</code> is a vector or a matrix containing
the ENDOR spectrum or spectra.
If <code>spec</code> is a matrix, the subspectra (various
transitions or various orientations) are along rows.
<li>
<code>trans</code> is a list of level number
pairs indicating the transitions which where included in the spectrum
calculations. Level numbers refer to the energy levels of the
Hamiltonian in ascending energy order, so level 1 has lowest
energy and so on.
</ul>

<p>
The three input arguments to the function are

<ul>
<li><code>Sys</code>: spin system (paramagnetic molecule)</li>
<li><code>Exp</code>: experimental parameters</li>
<li><code>Opt</code>: simulation options</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>Sys</code> is a <a href="spinsystem.html">spin system structure</a>.
Fields available in <code>Sys</code> include all needed
for the construction of a Hamiltonian and the ENDOR <a href="broadenings.html">line width parameter</a>
<code>lwEndor</code>. If <code>lwEndor</code> is not given, it is assumed to be zero,
and stick spectra are returned. The field <code>HStrain</code> is included in
excitation window computations (see <code>Exp.ExciteWidth</code>).

<p>
For simulating a multi-component mixture, <code>Sys</code> should be a cell array of spin systems,
e.g. <code>{Sys1,Sys2}</code> for a two-component mixture. Each of the component spin systems should
have a field <code>weight</code> that specifies the weight of the corresponding component in the final
spectrum.
</p>


<p>
<code>Exp</code> contains experimental parameters such as the microwave
frequency, the magnetic field range and temperature. Here is a full
list of its fields.


<table class="optionlist" border="1">

<tr><td><code>Field</code></td><td>
Magnetic field (in mT) at which the experiment is performed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Range</code></td><td>
Two-element array with lower and upper limit of the rf frequency
range <code>[rfmin rfmax]</code>. The values are in MHz. Example:
<code>Exp.Range = [1 30]</code>.
<p>If omitted, EasySpin tries
to determine the frequency range automatically.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>CenterSweep</code></td><td>
Two-element array with center and sweep width of the rf frequency
range <code>[rfcenter rfwidth]</code>. The values are in MHz. Example:
<code>Exp.CenterSweep = [51 10]</code>.
<p>If omitted, EasySpin tries
to determine the frequency range automatically.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>nPoints</code></td><td>
Number of points on the rf frequency axis. If not given, EasySpin sets this to 1024.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>mwFreq</code></td><td>
EPR spectrometer frequency in GHz. Only needed for orientation selection,
i.e. when <code>ExciteWidth</code> is given.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>ExciteWidth</code></td><td>
The excitation width of the microwave in MHz (responsible
for orientation selection). The excitation profile is assumed to be
Gaussian, and <code>ExciteWidth</code> is its FWHM. The default is infinity.
To obtain the full excitation with for a given orientation, <code>ExciteWidth</code>
is combined with <code>HStrain</code> from the spin system structure.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Temperature</code></td><td>
Temperature at which the experiment is performed, in K. If omitted (or set
to <code>inf</code>), no temperature effects are computed.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Orientations</code></td><td>
3xN array of real<br>
Specifies single-crystal orientations for which the ENDOR spectrum
should be computed. Each column of <code>Orientation</code>
contains the three Euler rotation angles <code>[phi;theta;chi]</code> of the
magnetic field in a molecule fixed frame. If <code>Orientation</code> is empty
or not specified, the full powder spectrum is computed.
<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Orientations = [0;0;0];              % crystal with z axis aligned with B0
Exp.Orientations = [0;pi/2;0];           % crystal with z axis perpendicular to B0
Exp.Orientations = [0 0 0;0 pi/2 0].';   % two orientations
Exp.Orientations = [];                   % powder
</pre>
</td></tr>


<tr><td><code>CrystalSymmetry</code></td><td>
<p>
Specifies the symmetry of the crystal, if single-crystal spectra to be simulated
(that is, if <code>Exp.Orientations</code> is specified). The crystal symmetry can
be either the number of the space group (between 1 and 230), the symbol of the
space group or the symbol of the associated point group.</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 11;      % space group number (between 1 and 230)
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'P21/m'; % space group symbol
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = 'C2h';   % point group, Sch&ouml;nflies notation
Exp.CrystalSymmetry = '2/m';   % point group, Hermann-Mauguin notation
</pre>

<p>
When <code>CrystalSymmetry</code> is given, <code>salt</code> automatically computes
the spectra of all symmetry-related sites in the crystal. If <code>CrystalSymmetry</code>
is not given, <code>salt</code> assumes space group 1 (P1, point group C1), which has
only one site per unit cell.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Ordering</code></td><td>
<em>scalar</em> (default: zero) or <em>function handle</em><br>
<p>
If a number is given in this field, it specifies the orientational distribution
of the paramagnetic molecules in the sample.

<p>If not given or set to zero,
the distribution is isotropic, i.e. all orientations occur with the same
probability. If it is given, the orientational distribution is non-isotropic
and computed according to the formula P(&theta;) = exp(&lambda;(3 cos<sup>2</sup>&theta; - 1)/2),
where &theta; is the angle between the molecular z axis and the static magnetic field, and
&lambda; is the number specified in <code>Exp.Ordering</code>.

<p>
Typical values for &lambda; are between about -20 and +20. For negative values, the orientational
distribution function is maximum at &theta; = 90&deg;, for positive values at &theta; = 0&deg; and &theta; = 180&deg;. The larger the magnitude of &lambda;, the sharper the
distributions.

<p>
To plot a distribution depending on &lambda;, use

<pre class="mlexample">
lambda = 5;
theta = linspace(0,pi,1001);
p = exp(lambda*plegendre(2,0,cos(theta)));
plot(theta*180/pi,p);
</pre>

<p>
If <code>Exp.Ordering</code> is a function handle, <code>pepper</code> will use the user-supplied
function to obtain the orientational distribution. It calls the function with two vector arguments, <code>phi</code>
and <code>theta</code> (in radians). The function must return a vector <code>P</code> containing probabilities for each
orientation, that is <code>P(k)</code> is the probability of finding the paramagnetic molecules with orientation
specified by <code>phi(k)</code> and <code>theta(k)</code>. Here is an example with an anonymous function:
</p>

<pre class="mlexample">
Exp.Ordering = @(phi,theta) gaussian(theta,0,15/180*pi);
</pre>

<p>
Of course, the function can also be written and stored in a separate file, e.g. <code>myori.m</code>. Then use <code>Exp.Ordering = @myori</code>.
</p>

<p>
When using a custom orientational distribution, make sure that the symmetry used in the simulation corresponds to the
symmetry of the distribution. If the distribution is very narrow, increase the number of knots in the options structure.
</p>

<p>
There are defaults for all fields except <code>Range</code> and
<code>Field</code>, which have to be specified when invoking <code>salt</code>.

<p>
The structure <code>Opt</code> collects a number of parameters allowing to
tune speed and accuracy of the simulation. <code>Opt</code> is optional, if it is
omitted, pre-set values for the parameters are used. The field names and their
possible values are

<table class="optionlist" border="1">
<tr><td><code>Method</code></td><td>
<code>'matrix'</code> (default) or <code>'perturb1'</code> or <code>'perturb2'</code><br>
Specifies the algorithm used for the ENDOR simulation. By default, matrix
diagonalization is used. This is an exact algorithm, but becomes slow when
many nuclei are present. In such cases, large speed-ups at the cost of small
losses in accuracy are possible using <code>'perturb1'</code>, first-order
perturbation theory, or <code>'perturb2'</code>, second-order perturbation theory.
Perturbation theory does not work for electron spins with S>1/2. It is accurate
only if the hyperfine coupling is much smaller than the microwave frequency, and
the nuclear quadrupole interaction is much smaller than both the hyperfine and
the nuclear Zeeman interaction.
<pre class="mlexample">
Opt.Method = 'perturb1';    % first-order perturbation theory
Opt.Method = 'matrix';      % matrix diagonalization
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Nuclei</code></td><td>
List of nuclei to include in the computation. <code>Nuclei</code> is a list
of indices selecting those nuclei for which ENDOR peaks should be computed. 1
is the first nucleus, etc. E.g. the following specifies ENDOR of only the protons
only in a copper complex.
<pre class="mlexample">
Sys.Nucs = '63Cu,1H,1H';
Opt.Nuclei = [2 3];      % only protons
</pre>
By default, all nuclei are included in the simulation.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Verbosity</code></td><td>
Determines how much information <code>salt</code> prints to the screen.
If <code>Opt.Verbosity=0</code>, <code>salt</code> is completely silent. 1 logs relevant information,
2 gives more details.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>nKnots</code></td><td>
<code>[N1]</code> or <code>[N1 N2]</code>
<br>
Determines the number of orientations (knots) in a powder simulation for which
spectra are calculated.

<ul>
<li>
<code>N1</code> gives the number of orientations between &theta;=0° and &theta;=90°
for which spectra are explicitely calculated using the physical theory.
Common values for <code>N1</code> are between 10 (10° increments) and 91 (1° increments).
The larger the anisotropy of the spectrum and the narrower the linewidth, the higher
<code>N1</code> must be to yield smooth powder spectra.

<li><code>N2</code> is the refinement factor for the interpolation of the orientational
grid. E.g. if <code>N2=4</code>, then between each pair of computed orientations
three additional orientations are calculated by spline interpolation. Values higher than 10
are rarely necessary. If <code>N2</code> is not given, a default value is used.
</ul>

<pre class="mlexample">
Opt.nKnots = 91;       % 1° increments, no interpolation
Opt.nKnots = [46 0];   % 2° increments, no interpolation
Opt.nKnots = [31 6];   % 3° increments, 6-fold interpolation (giving 0.5° increments)
</pre>
</td></tr>



<tr><td><code>Symmetry</code></td><td>
<code>'auto'</code> (default), <code>'Dinfh'</code>, <code>'D2h'</code>,
<code>'C2h'</code> or <code>'Ci'</code>
<br>
Determines the symmetry used for the powder simulation. Based on this
the set of orientations for which spectra are computed is chosen.
<code>'Dinfh'</code> corresponds to a line from &theta;=0° to &theta=90° (with
&phi;=0°), <code>'D2h'</code> to one octant, <code>'C2h'</code> to two octants,
and <code>'Ci'</code> to one hemisphere (four octants).
<code>auto</code> is the default,
meaning that <code>pepper</code> determines the correct symmetry
automatically from the given spin system. With any other setting, <code>pepper</code> is forced into
using the specified symmetry, even if it is incorrect for the spin system.

</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Output</code></td><td>
<code>'summed'</code> (default) or <code>'separate'</code><br>
Determines in what form the spectrum is returned. For powder spectra,
<code>'separate'</code> causes <code>salt</code> to return the spectra
for different transitions separately in <code>spec(k,:)</code>. For
single-crystal spectra, <code>'separate'</code> causes
<code>salt</code> to return the spectra for different orientations
(see <code>Exp.Orientations</code>)
separately. <code>'summed'</code> means that only one total
spectrum is returned.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>ThetaRange</code></td><td>
<em>2-element vector</em> (default: not given)<br>
This option allows <code>salt</code> to be used similar to older powder
ENDOR spectrum computation programs. There it was possible to include
effects of orientation selection and limited excitation bandwidths by
manually specifying the range of orientations to be included in the
"powder" spectrum. <code>ThetaRange</code> specifies the lower and
upper limit of &theta; (angle between the z axis of the molecular frame
and the external static magnetic field) for the orientations in the powder
simulation. So if <code>ThetaRange = [10 20]*180/pi</code>,
 only orientations in the segment with &theta; between
10&deg; and 20&deg; are included in the spectrum.
<br>
If <code>Opt.Symmetry</code> is not explicitely given, it is set to <code>'Ci'</code>.
<code>Opt.ThetaRange</code> cannot be used together with <code>Exp.Ordering</code> or 
<code>Exp.Orientations</code>.
</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
The following options are only available for matrix diagonalization (<code>Opt.Method='matrix'</code>),
but not for perturbation theory (<code>Opt.Method='perturb1'</code> or <code>'perturb2'</code>).

<table class="optionlist"  border="1">
<tr><td><code>Transitions</code></td><td>
Determine manually the level pairs (transitions) which are used in
the spectrum calculation. If given, <code>salt</code> uses them and skips its
automatic transition selection scheme. Level pairs are specified in
<code>Transitions(k,:)</code> by the level numbers which start with 1 for the
lowest-energy level.
<pre class="mlexample">
Opt.Transitions = [1 2];      % transition between levels 1 and 2
Opt.Transitions = [1 2; 5 6]; % 2 transitions, 1<->2 and 5<->6
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Enhancement</code></td><td>
<code>'off'</code> (default) or <code>'on'</code><br>
Switches hyperfine enhancement in the intensity computation on or off.
See the same option in <a class="esf" href="endorfrq.html">endorfrq</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Intensity</code></td><td>
<code>'on'</code> (default) or <code>'off'</code><br>
Switches all intensity computations on or off. Intensity computations include
the quantum-mechanical transition probability, the orientation selectivity and
the Boltzmann factor.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Threshold</code></td><td>
Specifies the threshold for <code>salt</code>'s transition selection scheme.
Any transition with a relative average amplitude less that
<code>Threshold</code> is not included in the calculation. The relative
average amplitude of the strongest transition is 1.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>OriPreSelect</code></td><td>
0 or 1 (default)<br>
Specifies whether <code>salt</code> uses automatic orientational pre-selection
to speed-up simulations. This speed-up is most noticeable for large spin
systems and field/frequency settings that lead to single-crystal like spectra.

<div class="subtitle">Algorithms</div>

<p><code>salt</code> computes line positions and intensities for a set of
orientations using either matrix diagonalization or perturbation theory.

<p>
The matrix diagonalization approach used in <code>salt</code> is identical to that
of <code>pepper</code>, with the obvious exception of the calculation of line intensities,
which is similar to that used in MAGRES (Keijzers et al, J.Chem.Soc. Faraday Trans. 1 83,
3493-3503, 1984).

<p>
First- and second-order perturbation theory is based on expressions by Iwasaki (J.Magn.Reson. 16,
417-423, 1974). It includes pseudosecular contributions. No transition moments are computed,
that is, the intensities of all resonances are equal. Currently, the perturbation-theory
algorithm is limited to systems with one electron spin S=1/2 (but an arbitrary number of
nuclei with arbitrary spins).

<p>
For powder simulations, <code>salt</code> uses the same methods as <code>pepper</code>,
orientational interpolation and interpolative projection, to construct the powder spectrum.

<div class="subtitle">Examples</div>

A full simulation of the powder ENDOR spectrum of a radical with a proton is
